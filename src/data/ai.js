    "Now that you have chosen a gynoid model, it's time to chose an Al for your gynoid. This is one of the most important choices and will determine your gynoids personality. All Al will by default be programmed to love you unconditionally and listen to your orders. You can purchase multiple Als and have 1 active Al while the others will be dormant within the gynoid. That will allow you to switch Al on your gynoid. If your gynoid have a Connection Cable or Wireless Connection you can transfer 1 of the the Gynoid's Al from your gynoid to your phone or computer to give it some personality. If your gynoid have a Holographic Projector than your gynoid can create a holographic body which can be controlled by one of the Gynoid's Al.",
