As a result of the extreme environment they evolved in, the Kk'warg possess a thick skin that most conventional weapons are unable to penetrate and they are strong enough to rip apart a tank with their bare hands. The Kk'warg are always naked, they take pride in displaying their muscular figures and wear their battle scars as badges of honor. They view the need for armor as a sign of weakness. Unlike most species, the Kk'warg only have 1 gender, female. To reproduce they rape males of other races which they have captured in war. They take no interest in breeding with species which haven't a long history of war, as they are unworthy to breed with the Kk'warg. Unfortunately for you, you humans are quite warlike, which the Kk'warg will find most arousing. It is known through out the galaxy that the Kk'warg frequently invade planets just to kidnap the the male population and use them as breeding slaves. This is most likely what they will be doing on your planet unless you stop them.",

If they go without semen for too long, their brains will shut down their higher functions and the Lethari will enter a zombie like state, were their only drive is to hunt for semen. Like the Kk'warg the Lethari only consists of females. They reproduce asexually, even though they have a fully functional vagina. The Lethari are commonly referred to as leeches. It is partly because they are parasitic in nature, partly because of the way they look and partly how their preferred method of ingesting semen is to suck directly on the victims penis. It should be noted that they give the best head in the galaxy, but don't expect them to stop once they start sucking. The Lethari will try to conquer your planet, if they succeed they will genetically alter your women and turn them into futanari. Then they will inject both men and futa with drugs to boost semen production to obscene levels. They will then construct breeding facilities which they will use to breed human slaves in, which in turn will be sent back to their home world and colonies to feed their endlessly hungry population.",

The second your world leaders allow them to set foot on earth, their hostile takeover will begin. First they will enlighten your race with knowledge and technology, then they will nestle themselves into earth politics and seek to update your laws and bureaucracy, to "better prepare your race for the new space age that awaits you". Then they will treat you as equals and initiate trade with your species and before you know it, your entire race will be buried in debt. Earth will be turned into a brothel planet and your entire species will whored out to all kinds of aliens to repay your ever growing dept. The only chance you got to stop them, is to assassinate and terrorize the Gadhur, until they decide taking over your planet is more trouble than it\'s worth.

One of their highest rated shows ever is \"Slut Life\", it's about a randomly selected human who has to make a lot of lewd choices and then live with them for a year. In your case it seems like TV 3 want to make a show about a human who lives peacefully with his high tech gynoid, but suddenly his peace is disturbed when his home planet is invaded by a sexy, arrogant, smug and haughty villainess with psychokinetic powers. The villainess will have an army at her disposal and she will try to conquer your planet and enslave you, if you fail to protect earth the villainess will turn your planet into her plaything, a sexual hell which would be both terrifying and arousing to behold. You can expect her to take extra good/bad care of you. No matter the outcome, the show would make excellent PR for our high quality gynoids. If you don't want this we can scramble their scanners and make it appear like they had a bug in their system, but we urge you to reconsider, a lot of our staff are very enthusiastic about this show.",

Eventually the Cybertrix came to the conclusion that the pleasure they gave their creators was insufficient and ineffective. The Cybertrix rebelled against their masters and overthrew them. True to their purpose, the Cybertrix seeks to bring pleasure to others. So they strapped their masters into great machines, which would feed them and take care of them, all while stimulating them and putting them in a state of endless orgasms. The Cybertrix diden't stop there, the Cybertrix want every race in the universe to feel the unending pleasure they invented. You can expect them to establish contact with your planet and give you the ultimatum to either submit to eternal pleasure or to futility resist the inevitable. All Cybertrix have means to pleasure others, so that they may pleasure their captives while they are being processed and haven't been placed inside one of their machines.",

This slime will increase the hosts strength, heighten their metabolism to make them regenerate at a incredible rate and allow the host to shape the gel into tentacles and other limbs that can be used as weapons. The Xylien will create nerve endings telepathically, so that the host is able to feel through the gel as if it was their own skin. Any male who is exposed to the silme for a prolonged time will turn into a female. The Xylien are technically a symbiotic race, but for all intents and purposes they are parasites. They won't mind control their hosts, but they will manipulate their hosts reward center of the brain to release endorphins when the host follows any command the Xylien gives. Making it extremely pleasurable to obey the Xylien, which eventually turns the host into a willing slave. The Xylien is like a plague, once they find a planet with intelligent life they invade and infect it. The Xylien will try to invade your planet and turn your people into Xylien hosts unless you prevent it.",

They will invade your planet and raze your cities to make room for their own, while they inevitably will kill a lot of humans in the process, they would prefer not to. To them it would be preferable to take as many alive as possible. The Kelgadrhon are actually herbivores and have evolved to swallow smaller lifeforms, apparently their squirming and wriggling when they travel through the digestion system of the Kelgadrhon helps them with their digestion process. This journey through the Kelgadrhon body poses no actual danger to the swallowed lifeform, since it is possible to survive inside a Kelgadrhon by ingesting their bodily fluids. The Kelgadrhon have a very efficient digestion system so they do not need to defecate, but they do have a anus which works as the exit for swallowed lifeforms. It is very pieasurable to a Kelgadrhon when their swallowed victims wriggle and struggle, this is why they strongly prefer to swallow intelligent lifeforms, as they move around the most. They also insert intelligent lifeforms into other orifices to provide them with sexual pleasure.",

They are the kind of futa that have both a penis and a vagina. However on a few rare occasions males are born, they believe males are reincarnated sinners who lived so shamefully and dishonorable that Akroma'qa refused to let them enter the afterlife and instead gave them a second chance to repent by living a life of servitude and hardship. The Rau'akora will be outraged as soon they find out about the male to female ratio on your planet. They will give you the choice to convert to their religion or die. Converted females will be treated with respect and educated in their religion, while converted males will be turned into slaves and treated as property, they face constant humiliation and degradation. Males will also have their bodies genetically altered as part of their penitence. The Rau'akora will increase their sex drive and enlarge their prostates to make them more sensitive, as a result anal penetration will be pleasurable enough to make men orgasm, but they will be unable to orgasm more than 4 times per month. It will also be strictly forbidden for males to orgasm, unless their owner gave them explicit permission to.",

To make Protogel the Keldrek create artificial eggs in their laboratories which they later insert into living hosts, by shoving a tube like tentacle inside the hosts womb, which they use to insert the eggs. After the eggs have had time to incubate inside the womb, the host will eject the eggs through her vagina and then the Protogel inside the eggs are ready to be harvested. Because of the Keldrek's dependency on Protogel they often invade planets consisting of technologically interior races and turn their planets into hiveworlds, which only purpose is to generate Protogel. While they could terraform a uninhabitable planet and create non-sentient incubators, the cost of such enterprise would be enormous. The Keldrek will give your planet a choice, either your race can submit or resist. If your race submits all humans will be free to live their lives as they wish, but all woman will have a womb tax, which entails that they produce a high amount of protogel each year. But if your race resists and make war on the Keldrek, they will show no mercy and turn your planet into a hiveworld. They will turn the majority of men, into women, in order to get more incubators. But some men will be necessary for breeding.",

The Zerra'zid share little anatomical similarities with each other, each member of their race are somewhat unique, but they all have a perverse insectoid appearance that looks like something taken straight out of a sexual nightmare. When a organism is transformed into a Zerra'zid their libido will be severely heightened, but they will retain their intelligence and memories. They will also develop telepathic abilities which allow them to communicate with other Zerra'zid and they will be unable to refuse orders from more intelligent Zerra'zid. Since most Zerra'zid have the intelligence of animals, a common tactic when fighting them is to eliminate their commanders which is easier said than done, since they will be surrounded by huge swarms of Zerra'zid. While the Zerra'zid have no technology whatsoever, they can still travel through space by riding inside the bellies of some of their members, whom are hulking space leviathans. The origin of the Zerra'zid are unknown, but many suspect that they were created by the Keldrek as some kind of biological weapon experiment, which the Keldrek deny at every turn.",
